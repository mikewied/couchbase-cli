couchbase-cli-failover(1)
=========================

NAME
----
couchbase-cli-failover - Failover a server in the cluster


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'couchbase-cli failover' [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
	  [--password <password>][--server-failover <server_list>] [--force]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command fails over one or more servers. Servers can be either hard failed
over or gracefully failed over. A hard failover means that the failover happens
immediately, but risk potential data loss. Graceful failover ensures that
replication is up to date before the server is failed over so that there is no
data loss, but the failover is not immediate. Using the --force flag means that
the failover should be a hard failover. If the --force flag is not specified
then the failover will be graceful. Note that if a server is already down you
must hard fail it over.

OPTIONS
-------

include::part-common-options.txt[]

--server-failover <server_list>::
	A comma separated list of servers to failover.

--force::
	Specifying this flag signifies that the nodes to be failed over should be
	hard failed over. A hard failover means that the failover is immediate, but
	you risk potential data loss. If this flag is not specified then the
	failover will occur only once replication is up to date. This means there
	will be no data loss, but the failover is not immediate. Note that if a
	server is already down you must hard fail it over.
