DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command collects all Couchbase log files from one or more nodes in the
cluster. Log collection is useful when there are failures in the cluster and you
need to figure out what is going on. Since there are many log files on various
different server the collect-logs-start command helps in aggregating all of the
different log file Couchbase Server creates.

To get the location of the collected log files you can run the
collect-logs-status command either while the log collection task is running or
after the log collection task has completed. If the --upload flag is specified

who need to upload logs to the Couchbase Support Team to aid in diagnosing
support tickets that they have filed.

--------

To collect logs on all nodes without uploading them run the following command.

	$ couchbase-cli collect-logs-start -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --all-nodes

If we have a three node cluster with IP addresses 192.168.1.5, 192.168.1.6, and
192.168.1.7 and we only want to collect logs on the first two nodes and we don't
want to upload the logs then we would run the command below.

	$ couchbase-cli collect-logs-start -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --nodes 192.168.1.5:8091,192.168.1.6:8091

I you are a Couchbase Enterprise Edition user and you need to upload logs for
all nodes for support ticket then you can run the following command.

	$ couchbase-cli collect-logs-start -c 192.168.1.5 --username Administrator \
