NAME
----
couchbase-cli-bucket-create - Create a Couchbase data bucket


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'couchbase-cli bucket-create' [--cluster <url>] [--username <user>]
	  [--password <password>] [--bucket <name>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Creates a new bucket. This command allows the creation of both Couchbase and
Memcached buckets and supports the various configuration parameters for these
buckets.

OPTIONS
-------

include::part-common-options.txt[]

--bucket <name>::
	The name of the bucket to create. The bucket name can only contain
	characters in range A-Z, a-z, 0-9 as well as underscore, period, dash and
	percent and can be a maximum of 100 characters in length.

--bucket-type <type>::
	The type of bucket to create. Accepted bucket types are "couchbase" and
	"memcached". The Couchbase bucket is the standard bucket type used by
	Couchbase. This bucket supports persistence, replication, caching, and
	indexing. The Memcached bucket type is a cache only bucket that does not
	support replication, indexing or persistence. This bucket type provides the
	same behavior as Memcached Server.

--bucket-ramsize <size>::
	The amount of memory to allocate to the cache for this bucket in Megabytes.
	The memory quota of this bucket must fit into the overall cluster memory
	quota. The minimum cache size is 100MB.

--bucket-replica <num>::
	The amount of servers to replicate data to. Replicas provide protection
	against data loss by keeping copies of the data in this bucket on multiple
	servers. By default the number of replicas is one even if there is only a
	single server in the cluster. The minimum amount of replicas is zero and the
	maximum number is three. This option is only valid for couchbase buckets.

--bucket-priority <priority>::
	The disk I/O priority for this bucket. The value of this flag may be set to
	high or low. By default the priority is set to low. This option is only
	valid for couchbase buckets. This setting only has an affect on the disk IO
	if there are other buckets in the cluster.

--bucket-password <password>::
	The passoword for authenticating with this bucket. If this option is not set
	or the password is set to the empty string then this bucket will not require
	authentication.

--bucket-eviction-policy <policy>::
	The memory cache eviction policy for this bucket. Couchbase buckets support
	either "valueOnly" eviction or "fullEviction". Specifying the
	"valueEviction" policy means that each key stored in this bucket must be
	kept in memory. This is the default policy and using this policy will
	improve performance of key-value operations, but limits the maximum size of
	the bucket. Using the "fullEviction" policy means that performance will be
	impacted for key-value operations, but the maximum size of the bucket is
	unbounded.

--enable-flush <num>::
	Specifies whether or not the flush operation is allowed for this bucket. To
	enable flush set this option to "1". To disable flush set this option to
	"0". By default flush is disabled.

--enable-index-replica <num>::
	Enables replica view indexes for this bucket. There may be at most 1 view
	replica index. To enable replica indexes set the value of this option to
	"1". To disable replica indexes set the value of this option to "0". By
	default replica indexes are disabled.

--wait
	The create bucket command is asynchronous by default. Specifying this flag
	makes this a synchronous operation by waiting for the bucket to be fully
	created before the command returns.

EXAMPLES
--------

To create a Couchbase bucket named "travel-data" with password "password" which
has a memory cache size of 1GB run the following command.

	$ couchbase-cli bucket-create -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --bucket travel-data --bucket-type couchbase \
	 --bucket-ramsize 1024 --bucket-password password

To create a Couchbase bucket named "airline-data" with password "password" has a
memory cache size of 1GB, two data replicas, high disk I/O priority, uses full
eviction, and has flush and replica indexes enabled run the following command.

	$ couchbase-cli bucket-create -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --bucket travel-data --bucket-type couchbase \
	 --bucket-ramsize 1024 --bucket-password password --bucket-replicas 2 \
	 --bucket-priority high --bucket-eviction-policy fullEviction \
	 --enable-flush 1 --enable-index-replica 1

To create a Memcached bucket named "travel-data" with password "password" which
has a memory cache size of 1GB run the following command.

	$ couchbase-cli bucket-create -c 192.168.1.5:8091 --username Administrator \
	 --password password --bucket travel-data --bucket-type memcached \
	 --bucket-ramsize 1024 --bucket-password password
